## Glossary of Terms

### Work Order
A formal request for maintenance, inspection, or other work to be performed. Contains details such as title, description, location, priority, assigned inspector(s), and required inspections.

### Template
A structured form definition that defines the questions, sections, and data collection requirements for a specific type of inspection. Templates can include conditional logic, scoring rules, and media requirements.

### Inspection
The actual execution of a template by an inspector. Contains the responses, scores, photos, signatures, and other data collected during the inspection process.

### Corrective Action
A task or action item created as a result of failed inspection items or identified issues. Includes assignment, priority, due date, and tracking of completion status.

### Inspector
A field user who performs inspections using the mobile application. Has access to assigned work orders and can complete inspections offline.

### Approval Workflow
The process by which completed inspections are reviewed by quality auditors or supervisors for compliance and accuracy before final approval.

### Offline Sync
The capability of the mobile app to function without internet connectivity, storing data locally and synchronizing with the server when connection is restored.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Security model that restricts system access based on user roles and assigned permissions.
